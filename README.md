# Number System Generation and Presentation using NumJpy, OpenCV, and TensorFlow

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the generation of a number system using the NumJpy library and its presentation using OpenCV (cv2). Additionally, it incorporates the use of TensorFlow for digit recognition. The primary objective is to integrate number system creation with image processing and machine learning techniques for visualization and analysis. This project is a part of the Digital Image Processing coursework.
